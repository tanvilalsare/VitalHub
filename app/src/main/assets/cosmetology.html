    <h1>Harmful Chemicals in Cosmetics</h1>

    <h2>Butylated HydroxyAnisole and Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT)</h2>
    <p>
      These synthetic antioxidants are commonly used to extend product shelf life. 
      But don’t be fooled - these are not like natural, good-for-you antioxidants. 
      Instead, they are likely <span class="warning">carcinogens</span> and 
      <span class="warning">hormone disruptors</span> that may cause liver damage.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA)</h2>
    <p>
      EDTA is a chelating (binding) agent added to cosmetics to improve product stability. 
      It’s supposed to keep active ingredients in a formula from binding with trace elements, like minerals, that are present in water. 
      It also prevents a product’s texture, odor, and consistency from changing.
    </p>

    <h2>Hydroquinone</h2>
    <p>
      This skin-bleaching and skin-lightening chemical is meant to inhibit the production of melanin. 
      In the short term, this can help with dark spots and discoloration. In the long-term, though, the chemical is linked to 
      <span class="warning">cancer</span>, <span class="warning">organ toxicity</span>, and <span class="warning">skin irritation</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Oxybenzone</h2>
    <p>
      This sunscreen agent and ultraviolet light absorber is found in the majority of over-the-counter sunscreens. 
      It acts like estrogen in the body and, as a result, is linked to <span class="warning">endometriosis</span> and altered sperm production.
    </p>

    <h2>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS and SLES)</h2>
    <p>
      SLS and SLES are surfactants that can cause skin irritation and trigger allergies. They have been shown to contribute to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="warning">Skin irritation</span> and canker sores</li>
      <li>Disruption of the skin’s natural oil balance</li>
      <li>Eye damage</li>
      <li>Widely believed to contribute to cystic acne, particularly around the mouth and chin</li>
    </ul>
