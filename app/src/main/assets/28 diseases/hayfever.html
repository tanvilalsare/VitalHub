    <h1>Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever)</h1>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2>What is Hay Fever?</h2>
        <p>Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, causes cold-like symptoms. These may include a runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, sneezing, and sinus pressure. But unlike a cold, hay fever isn't caused by a virus. It is caused by an allergic response to a harmless outdoor or indoor substance the body identifies as harmful (allergen).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Hay fever symptoms can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Runny nose and nasal stuffiness, called congestion.</li>
            <li>Watery, itchy, red eyes.</li>
            <li>Sneezing.</li>
            <li>Cough.</li>
            <li>Itchy nose, roof of mouth or throat.</li>
            <li>Mucus that runs down the back of the throat, called postnasal drip.</li>
            <li>Swollen, bruised-appearing skin under the eyes, known as allergic shiners.</li>
            <li>Extreme tiredness and fatigue, often due to poor sleep.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Hay Fever Triggers</h2>
        <p>Your hay fever symptoms may occur year-round or may start or worsen at a particular time of year. These are known as seasonal allergies. Hay fever triggers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tree pollen, which is common in early spring.</li>
            <li>Grass pollen, which is common in late spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Ragweed pollen, which is common in fall.</li>
            <li>Dust mites and cockroach droppings, which are present year-round.</li>
            <li>Dander from pets, which can be bothersome year-round but might cause worse symptoms in winter, when houses are closed up.</li>
            <li>Spores from indoor and outdoor fungi and molds, which can be both seasonal and year-round.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">How to Tell Hay Fever from a Common Cold</h2>
        <p>In hay fever, you don’t get a fever, but in the common cold, there is a low-grade fever involved, in addition to body aches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>The following can increase a person's risk of developing hay fever:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Having other allergies or asthma.</li>
            <li>Having a condition called atopic dermatitis or eczema, which makes skin irritated and itchy.</li>
            <li>Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with allergies or asthma.</li>
            <li>Living or working in an environment that constantly exposes someone to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites.</li>
            <li>Being exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose.</li>
            <li>Having a mother who smoked during the first year of life.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>
        <p>Healthcare professionals can help develop a treatment plan for hay fever symptoms, focusing on limiting exposure to triggers and using nonprescription or prescription medicines. Combining allergy medicines can provide the best relief. Children should consult their healthcare professional about treatment, as not all medicines are approved for use in children.</p>
