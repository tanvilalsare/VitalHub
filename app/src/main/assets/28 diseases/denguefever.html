    <h1>Dengue Fever</h1>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104°F (40°C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Muscle, bone, or joint pain</li>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Pain behind the eyes</li>
            <li>Swollen glands</li>
            <li>Rash</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong class="important">Warning signs of severe dengue fever</strong> — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. The warning signs usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Severe stomach pain</li>
            <li>Persistent vomiting</li>
            <li>Bleeding from your gums or nose</li>
            <li>Blood in your urine, stools, or vomit</li>
            <li>Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising</li>
            <li>Difficult or rapid breathing</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Irritability or restlessness</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Causes</h2>
        <p>Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses. You can't get dengue fever from being around an infected person. Instead, dengue fever is spread through mosquito bites.</p>
        <p>The two types of mosquitoes that most often spread the dengue viruses are common both in and around human lodgings. When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito. Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection.</p>
        <p>After you've recovered from dengue fever, you have long-term immunity to the type of virus that infected you — but not to the other three dengue fever virus types. This means you can be infected again in the future by one of the other three virus types. Your risk of developing severe dengue fever increases if you get dengue fever a second, third, or fourth time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>You have a greater risk of developing dengue fever if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You live or travel in a tropical area</li>
            <li>You have had dengue fever in the past</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Complications</h2>
        <p>Severe dengue fever can cause internal bleeding and organ damage. Blood pressure can drop to dangerous levels, causing shock. In some cases, severe dengue fever can lead to death.</p>
        <p>Women who get dengue fever during pregnancy may be able to spread the virus to the baby during childbirth. Additionally, babies of women who get dengue fever during pregnancy have a higher risk of pre-term birth, low birth weight, or fetal distress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Prevention</h2>
        <p><strong class="important">Vaccine</strong> – Dengue fever vaccines may be available for people ages 6 to 60.</p>
        <p>Prevent mosquito bites – If you live or travel to an area where dengue fever is common, these tips may help reduce your risk of mosquito bites:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened housing</li>
            <li>Wear protective clothing</li>
            <li>Use mosquito repellent</li>
            <li>Reduce mosquito habitat</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>
        <p>There is no specific medicine to treat dengue infection. In case of infection, the patient should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid medicines with aspirin, which could worsen bleeding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="section-title">Medication Information and Side effects – Acetaminophen</h2>
        <p>Acetaminophen is used to treat mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with opiates, or to reduce fever. Common conditions treated include headache, muscle aches, arthritis, backache, toothaches, sore throat, colds, flu, and fevers.</p>
        <p>Acetaminophen is also available in many over-the-counter combination medications with other drugs, including Actifed, Alka-Seltzer Plus Liquid Gels, Cepacol, Contac, Coridicin, Dayquil, Dimetapp, Dristan, Excedrin, Feverall, Liquiprin, Midol, Nyquil, Panadol, Robitussin Singlet, Sinutab, Sudafed, Theraflu, Triaminic, Vanquish, Vicks, and Zicam.</p>
